this is crazy to me like i actually really enjoy playing this game with friends. i normally dislike competitive games but i think the way the splatoon team designed their game makes it so you cant really get mad? short matches, short queue times, no elo system, amazing music, and a nice community. plus it has multiple modes and a campaign?? genuinely might be the only competitive game i enjoy and im so excited to play more with my friends
